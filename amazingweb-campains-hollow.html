      <h1 class="title">HOLLOWKNIGHT</h1>
      <p>I started to play this campain in...I don´t remember when I
       started to play it, but it was about six or five years ago.
       This campain is based on the game Hollowknight, which has been
       recognized as one of the best games ever created, its story is
       reach and complex, the characters are uncanny and cryptic, and the
       art is just stunning. </p>
      <p>Despite being a game for a single player, my Dungeon Master, using
       his holy and infinite creativity, adapted the main story for us to
       play. At the beggining we were just two players: my friend Zaid
       (whose character was a dragonborn called Kriv), and I. Later,
       Paloma, who is a friend of us, joined us with her character Althaea.>      <p>The main idea of my DM was making us fight with small bosses and s>       increase the dificulty level, however, the party had different plans>       we went directly for the main boss (level 1 characer vs level 20 boss       what could go wrong?), it went terryibly wrong. Kriv died and Zaid
       had to build a different character. </p>
      <p>Before Kriv´s death, we all learned an important lesson: take it e>       and don´t rush, or you will probably die. The party continued on the>       and we had to fight against many hard masive bosses.</p>
      <p>Today we have only defeated two of the three main bosses of the
       game. It has been a long way and we can´t give up until ending the
       campain! We will probably end it next year, I hope. hehe</p>
