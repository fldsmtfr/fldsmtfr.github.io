    <p>Here you can read a small resume of each campain I am currently 
     playing. All of them are original, my DM idea.Enjoy reading</p>
    <p>It might seem I dont play that much because I have very few
       capains, but I play every saturday at 10 with my friends, I have 
       been playing with my same group of frinds for almost 7 years and
       I dont regret anythiiiing, the best years of my life, hehe </p>
